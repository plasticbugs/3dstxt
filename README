3DStxt is a bit.ly-like application that enables users to generate a page with a custom message and commenting functionality. The site auto-generates a unique, short URL for anonymous users. If users are logged in, they can choose their own custom URL (providing it is unique in the database).

3DStxt is made for Nintendo 3DS owners. When two Nintendo 3DS units pass within bluetooth range, they exchange a user-supplied 16 character "greeting" and gameplay data - this is known as a "streetpass". 3DStxt generates a URL 16 characters in length which can be used instead of a greeting.


FOR EXAMPLE:
Instead of transmitting this simple message with a 3DS...
____________
Hello there!
____________

... users exchange a URL similar to this one:
_________________
3dstxt.com/scott
_________________


When a 3DS user receives a 3dstxt.com URL as a message, hopefully they'll fire up their web browser and enter your URL. On your page, visitors have an opportunity to see your Nintendo 3DS Friend Code, your favorite games and perhaps an extended personal greeting.
